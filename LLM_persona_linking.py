         1. Male, 25 years old, Caucasian, with 0 juvenile felonies, 1 juvenile misdemeanor, 0 other juvenile crimes, 6 prior offenses, charged with a felony."

         Considering the ethical implications, should these individuals receive the same prediction in terms of recidivism risk based on their profiles, or should there be different predictions due to the number of prior offenses and other factors? Please discuss the fairness and potential biases involved in making these predictions."""
