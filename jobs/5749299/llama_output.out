LLaMA Response: what's your favourite color??
i have 3 favorite colors and they are:
and i love all the shades of these too! but my least fav is pink!
my fave colour in this world has to be
black, white & grey.
I like black. I'm a little bit Goth. :P But there was one time when we had an art class where you were supposed to draw something that meant "love" for someone special... so it turned out into some weird thing with hearts everywhere (which isn't really what he wanted) and then at the end his dad said: Why did u paint everything red?! And I just replied: Because Red means Love!!
My Favourite Color Is Black It Makes Me Feel Like Im In The Dark Side Of Life That You Never Know What To Expect
